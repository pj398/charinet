This is the source repository for {movienet}, which is a pseudo-package for doing character interaction network analysis in R. In reality, it is the result of my converting the code I used during my PhD, including a number of tools for reading, summarising and visualising networks based on film dialogue, into an R package to streamline my workflow when working on movie network projects locally. As such, it's not particularly well-documented and inherently 'in development' (i.e. unstable).
