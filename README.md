This is the source repository for {charinet}, which is a pseudo-package for doing *char*acter *i*nteraction *net*work analysis in R. In reality, it is the result of my converting and improving the code I used during my PhD (including a number of tools for reading, summarising and visualising networks based on film dialogue) into an R package to streamline my workflow when working on movie network projects locally. I am still in the process of making this user-friendly and the package is therefore inherently 'in development' (i.e. unstable). 

For the associated data package, which is already released, see [movienetData](https://github.com/pj398/movienetData).
